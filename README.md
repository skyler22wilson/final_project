# Inventory Optimization for Mechanical Parts

This project focuses on optimizing inventory management for mechanical parts using a combination of machine learning techniques and business analytics. The goal is to minimize customer Lifetime Value (LTV) while efficiently categorizing parts and providing actionable insights for parts managers to optomize the inventory they hold. 

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key components:

- **XGBoost Regressor**: A machine learning model used to minimize customer Lifetime Value (LTV) through predictive analytics.

- **Aglomerative Clustering**: A technique used to classify data into three categories: essential, non-essential, and obsolete parts.

- **Business Analytics**: An analysis file that provides insights into business performance and guides decision-making.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A preliminary analysis of the data to understand its characteristics and patterns.

- **Data Cleaning**: A process to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.

- **Feature Preprocessing**: Combination of Select K Best and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to preprocess the features.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilization of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization of the XGBoost model.
